      <h2>App service terms and conditions</h2>
      
      <h3>Acceptance of conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Each User acknowledges having read all of the Terms and Conditions and the User Terms and Conditions and expressly accepts them without reservation.
      </p>

      <h3>Terms and conditions for in-application purchases and subscriptions</h3>
      
      <h4>Scope of application of these conditions</h4>
      <p>
        By purchasing an in-app purchase or a subscription to one of Spark Games' mobile games, you agree that you are submitting a legally binding offer to enter into a contract and acknowledge that you have the legal capacity to enter into such a contract or that you have the permission of your parent or legal guardian to enter into this legal contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that use of Spark Games mobile games downloaded through the Apple AppStore is subject to Apple's End User License Agreement.
      </p>

      <h4>Acquire subscriptions or in-app purchases from Apple or Google</h4>
      <p>
        Subscriptions and in-app purchases are purchased and billed by Apple AppStore or Google PlayStore and not by Spark Games. These purchases are subject to Apple's or Google's terms and conditions. Spark Games does not have access to user accounts or transactions. If you wish to confirm the type of subscription purchased on these platforms, please refer to your account or receipt, as each subscription will have a unique billing name.
      </p>
      <p>
        In-game purchases on mobile devices use the payment method you have registered with the Apple App Store or the Google Play account registered on your device. For more information, please refer to the Apple or Google support articles.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Ads: In App Purchase</strong> - In most Spark Games mobile games it is possible for users to purchase a feature called "No Ads". It is expressly stated that this feature is intended to stop the display of all advertisements that may interrupt our users' gaming experience.
          <br /><br />
          Please note that this feature does not affect the ability of all players to benefit from additional bonuses that can be unlocked by watching "reward videos" between levels or games. These "reward videos" are videos that players can choose to watch to get something (e.g. double their points, get more gems, new skins or avatars, etc.). Since it is the users' choice whether or not to watch these videos, the "ad-free" feature does not prevent users who have paid to do so in order to get more in-game items and bonuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Auto-renewing subscriptions</strong> - In some of its mobile games, Spark Games offers its users the possibility to purchase a weekly or monthly subscription for a fixed price indicated in that application in order to access specific services expressly made available by Spark Games for their use.
          <br /><br />
          Users will be charged the renewal fee within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
          <br /><br />
          You agree that the price with respect to the subscribed services is final and shall not be subject to refund by Spark Games.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Termination of subscription</h3>
      
      <h4>Termination by the user</h4>
      <p>Subscriptions are managed through the Apple AppStore or Google Playstore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel them.</li>
        <li>If you cancel, you can continue to use the subscription until the next billing date.</li>
        <li>If you unsubscribe during a trial period, you may lose access to the content immediately.</li>
        <li>If you have subscribed to a free or discounted trial and do not want to renew it, cancel it at least 24 hours before it ends.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Termination by Spark Games</h4>
      <p>
        Except as provided below in connection with subscription renewal, Spark Games may cancel, suspend or terminate your access to subscribed services if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The User is in breach of the conditions.</li>
        <li>Spark Games is suspicious of any illegal activity associated with the user.</li>
        <li>Spark Games suspects that certain instances of fraud or misuse have occurred.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The subscription is subject to automatic renewal unless the user unsubscribes 24 hours before the end of the current week corresponding to the subscription period. If the user does not withdraw, the user will be charged for the next subscription period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can directly manage the automatic renewal using the functionality provided in his iTunes Account settings.
      </p>
